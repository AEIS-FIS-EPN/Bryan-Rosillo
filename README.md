# Portafolio

As a professional, it is very important to share your summary with the world, and a personal portfolio is a good idea to do so, because with this you will be able to show your experience and projects through a dynamic website. The mission of this repository is to provide an idea to build a portfolio with simple technologies such as html, css, etc...

# About the project <a name='about-the-project'></a>

This project is a website that contains a personal portfolio with its most fundamental parts, such as: 
- A welcome
- A section about you
- Your experience
- Contacts

# Technologies used <a name='technologies-used'></a>

To create the web site I used: 
- HTML <br> <img src="https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/913/851/png-clipart-responsive-web-design-html-world-wide-web-consortium-world-wide-web-angle-text.png" alt="logo html" width="50" height="50"/>
- CSS <br> <img src="https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/603/759/png-clipart-css3-cascading-style-sheets-logo-html-world-wide-web-blue-angle-thumbnail.png" alt="logo css" width="50" height="50"/>
- Javascript <br> <img src="https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/640/199/png-transparent-javascript-logo-html-javascript-logo-angle-text-rectangle-thumbnail.png" alt="logo html" width="50" height="50"/>
- React <br> <img src="https://static-00.iconduck.com/assets.00/react-icon-2048x2048-o8k3ymqa.png" width="50" height="50"/>

# Installation and use <a name='installation-and-use'></a>
**Before starting, it is very important to mention that you need to have Node js installed**.

First, you have to clone the repository on your PC. For this, you can use this command: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AEIS-FIS-EPN/Bryan-Rosillo.git
```

Or in turn, you can download the project as ZIP. <br><br>

Then open the folder and use these commands:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
The first is used to install certain dependencies, and the second is used to compile the program.
If everything went well, a window with the web page should open in your browser.

If there is any problem, do not hesitate to tell me :D.
